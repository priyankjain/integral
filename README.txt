Create a program in C that will give a numerical value to the integral of the polynomial of the form:

integral (ax^2 + bx +c)dx from a limit right to a limit left.

The equation to integrate will always be a polynomial of second degree. You must use the trapezoidal rule with the domain discretized into N equally spaced panels. 

The coefficients a, b and c along with the right limit, left limit and N will be written in a separate file called "data.txt" and will be written on the same line in the following order: a b c leftlimit rightlimit N. Their values will always be real numbers.

The final result will be displayed in the program in the following form: 

final result: result
